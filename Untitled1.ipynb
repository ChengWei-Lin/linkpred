    "        1. do not exclude currently.\n",
    "        2. it is a useful variable to see if it's presented already or not, (might put it to ERGM to see if high correlation between networks is due to it has presented already \n",
    "        3. excluding presented edge to predict new edge occur in the future is a way, but we want to preserve this information\n",
    "    2. should exclude new presented nodes in testing network, otherwise there's no way to predict\n",
    "    3. however, when using edge betweenness in testing network, we want to see its importance in its current/future network, not the one excludes new nodes.\n",
    "    4. try to find the threshold, the output only presents predict links\n",
    "    5. AUR ROC , (x,y)-(katz, betweenness), plot with z-score to scale, compare different algorithms(tp only), further can compare tp,fp,tn,fn\n",
    "    6. add one more column, cluster coefficient of edge"
